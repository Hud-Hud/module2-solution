            <div class="category"> Ocean</div>

            On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. ... Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds.
